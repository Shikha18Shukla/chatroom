# 🔐 Secured Chatroom

This project is a **real-time secure chatroom** built to understand and enhance communication security. It demonstrates how encrypted messaging, authentication, and socket-based communication can be implemented efficiently in a chat application.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant chat using WebSockets or Socket.IO  
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system  
- **Message Encryption:** End-to-end encryption for private conversations  
- **Efficient Data Flow:** Optimized message handling and minimal latency  
- **User Status Tracking:** Online/offline indicators  
- **Error Handling:** Safe disconnections and message recovery support  

---

## 🔒 Security Highlights

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Messages are encrypted on the sender’s side and decrypted only by the receiver.  
- **Secure Socket Layer:** All connections are established over HTTPS/WSS.  
- **Hashed Passwords:** Uses bcrypt or SHA-256 for user credential storage.  
- **Token-Based Authentication:** JWT or session-based user verification.  
- **Input Sanitization:** Prevents XSS and injection attacks.
